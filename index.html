<h2>Basics to my philosophy</h2>
     <p> Early to bed
Holistic approach
Active meditation
Bioenergetic boon
I resist labels but it’s hard for people to know who you are and what you’re doing if you don’t label yourself…I’m a coach. I’m a healer. And I support people in becoming the strongest version of themselves…I’m a holistic strength coach.
